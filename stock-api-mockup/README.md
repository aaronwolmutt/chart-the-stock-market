# Stock API mock up

Developed for my chart-the-stock-market Redux Toolkit & React UI with RTK Query client. Provides a REST API and friendlier JSON format for historical stock time series data. I'm willing to host this servicing and provide specs on request.

## Start the service

```bash
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
$ python3 app.py
```
